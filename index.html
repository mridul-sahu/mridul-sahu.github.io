                            <li><strong>Checkpoint Restoration & Distribution:</strong> Streamlined how training restarts from a single saved copy (Single Replica Restore) and how that data is efficiently shared (Broadcast) across all processing units, especially in complex, multi-device environments. This reduced startup times and resource bottlenecks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Resolved critical performance and stability issues within the <strong>Orbax checkpointing library</strong> for large-scale model training on cloud platforms, unblocking key enterprise users by addressing complex multi-device and storage interaction bugs.</li>
                    <li>Architected and led the development of a new, extensible <strong>ML Checkpointing Benchmark Framework</strong> for Orbax, featuring a modular design, YAML configuration, and automated CI/CD pipelines for continuous performance regression detection across various hardware. Designed key components for open-source compatibility to foster community engagement and simplify external debugging.</li>
                    <li>Driving foundational checkpointing improvements through these Orbax enhancements within the <strong>Gemax Prod</strong> initiative, thereby bolstering the reliability, scalability, and overall performance of training workflows for Google's State-of-the-Art (SOTA) foundation models.</li>
                    <li>Led the design and development of the Knowledge Distillation module for <strong>Tunix</strong> (JAX-native LLM post-training library), enhancing model efficiency. Architected a flexible framework using a strategy pattern to support diverse distillation techniques, including advanced logit-matching and feature/attention-based methods. Implemented novel utilities for dynamic intermediate feature extraction and dimension alignment (pooling/projection) across heterogeneous model architectures, enabling broader adoption of model compression.</li>
                    <li>Playing a key role in establishing and scaling the new <strong>Core ML India team</strong> by mentoring engineers and providing expert technical guidance across pivotal Google Machine Learning verticals, including Keras, Keras Hub, Jax 3P, Orbax, and Gemax Prod.</li>

                    <li>Architected and built a resilient microservices-based service mesh from scratch (leveraging Zookeeper, Redis, Nginx, Elastic Search, MongoDB, MySQL with gRPC & RESTful APIs) to establish robust baseline infrastructure. Created configurations and automation scripts to deploy and manage services on Kubernetes Clusters, orchestrating with GCP services and utilizing Istio for enhanced security, control, and observability.</li>
                    <li>Founded and delivered curriculum for an online coding education platform (Zopte Academy). Responsibilities encompassed building modules for streaming/recording sessions (Nginx, HLS) and developing a Go & Angular Dart-based student progress management system, alongside full-stack codebase maintenance.</li>
                    <li>Developed a suite of versatile pluggable widgets, user flows, and UI components using Flutter and Angular Dart, significantly enabling developers to build and iterate on applications with greater efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Key R&D / Internal Projects:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a foundational <strong>ML pipeline</strong> (Dlib, Tesseract, TensorFlow, OpenCV) in Python and Golang to extract valuable information from diverse data streams (e.g., analyzing poker gameplay, detecting room activity, conceptualizing indoor cat tracking).</li>
                            <li>Contributed to the development of an algorithmic trading platform using classification/regression models to predict trading patterns from price data and public company information, with further plans to integrate news/social media feeds.</li>
                            <li>Prototyped a social media application, Pawsome (not in production), using Flutter and Golang, designed to encourage community-based care for stray pets.</li>
