                    <li>Architected and implemented the <strong>foundational backend system for determining user eligibility for Google One benefits</strong>, resolving complex large-scale orchestration challenges. This system became the <strong>cornerstone for a major customer acquisition feature</strong>, providing consistent eligibility data across multiple touchpoints and achieving a <strong>70% performance optimization</strong> over its initial version.</li>
                    <li>Designed and deployed a <strong>comprehensive reconciliation framework within Google One</strong> to proactively identify, prevent, and mitigate data inconsistencies with numerous Google partner teams (e.g., Photos, YouTube, Workspace, GStore), with the strategic aim of <strong>minimizing consumer complaints related to benefits</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Led the end-to-end design, implementation, and <strong>successful rollout of multiple major benefit launches and international expansions</strong>, directly impacting <strong>XX Million users</strong>. Functioned as the central technical liaison for various cross-Product Areas, coordinating complex efforts across global, multi-functional teams.</li>
                    <li>Identified and rectified critical <strong>infrastructure deficiencies within Google One that affected millions of users</strong>, delivering extensible solutions that significantly hardened the existing infrastructure and enhanced overall product reliability.</li>
                    <li>Engineered backend capabilities for an advanced benefits feature, enabling internal and external partners to <strong>dynamically split or combine benefits</strong>, thereby allowing for more tailored and effective information delivery to users.</li>
                    <li>Established and evangelized best practices for <strong>comprehensive alerting, SLOs, and monitoring capabilities</strong> across both existing services and new features, ensuring early detection of outages and bugs to maintain a superior user experience.</li>
                    <li>Provided key design contributions to launches owned by teammates, fostering the development of a <strong>more robust and versatile system architecture</strong> capable of supporting expanded use cases and enabling wider product experimentation.</li>
